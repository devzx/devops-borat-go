@pharkmillups please of add Kazakhstan government to list. They start with baby step of use Riak as FTP server.
Electronic mail postman always tweet twice.
In startup we are require all manual tester show kata move in morning before we allow them sit at keyboard.
Is not size of infrastructure in cloud, is size of cloud in infrastructure.
Quick message for #xp2011 participant: don't!
You are not cloud expert if you are not spend 1 night/month of deal with shit hit the fan.
For Azamat birthday I am plan of buy him 1 year of level Gold support for Cisco Flip camera.
Azamat has start new big project "Distributed Self-Heal Database, Motherfucker".
@wattersjames good cloud strategy: 1)try private cloud & fail;2)try public cloud & fail;3)try hybrid cloud & fail;4)teach of cloud success
@dsalons @jasonpeacock if interested I offer private cloud lesson.
Source of Microsoft is tell me little know fact that only way listen to Google Music is by use Skype! #googleio
Attention #googleio attendee! If got wrong version of tablet with Win XP Tablet Edition, please come at booth and get free Windows Phone 7!
Attention devops! Once you are install MS Skype, is only possible remove by use new security product MS AntiSkype!
Microsoft is reveal little know fact of Skype: real name is Hotchat, is run on FreeBSD!
Simple proof of cloud not exist: Hybrid cloud is both private and public. Hybrid cloud not exist. So private & public cloud not exist.
Source of Amazon is tell me for demo of disaster recovery at #interop they are shut down 1 zone of US East. All customer are refund!
Azamat is dissapoint computer on 25 US dollar USB stick is run Ubuntu. He is work on port of OpenBSD, is better community support.
@jpetazzo if have backups, YOU WIN ME!
@jonsterling difference is everything I say is from experience or minimum from Azamat experience.
Is hard explain for Azamat difference of node.js and Go language because in end EBS is still bring site down regardless.
NodeConf attendee: not forget at end of day tomorrow Joyent is reveal single laptop which is run no.de cloud!
Source of Microsoft is tell me 45% of all server in Azure cloud is apply Windows update at any give time. Other 35% are rebooting.
@johnmark can not able travel, need of be 24x7 in radius of pager which not work outside Kazakhstan.
@vambenepe github or it not happen.
Is good see RedHat final release own cloud with OpenShit.
Azamat is work on automatic deployment of Windows cloud. Is very easy with .bat file and AutoIt.
In devops is true size (of infrastructure) matter!
For OpenStack networking in startup we contribute Packet-Dropped-as-a-Service!
IaaS and PaaS are of similar in both rip you new one. Is difference that with PaaS you not know how they are do it.
How many cloud expert is take change lightbulb? Is not possible, cloud expert can only able give advice on avoid lightbulb outage in future!
Cloud expert at #openstack summit also coin term Closet Cloud, is private cloud which not dare expose public API.
We have first agreement of OpenStack summit! If site is down is proper procedure of first blame IaaS then PaaS and last SaaS.
@mgualtieri you are see in future if you write report before EC2 outage! "DevOps Is Good, But Cloud Computing Will Usher In NoOps"!!!
@wattersjames you are confuse. Perhaps you see Azamat, I send him to OpenStack summit. He is in PaaS track because zero failure there.
@ShlomoSwidler in startup we implement own Chaos Monkey for private cloud. Is combination of automate script and human with wire cutter.
Cloud expert at OpenStack summit are final settle on Network-as-a-Service principle of design. Just open a socket!
When going is get tough in one cloud, tough devops is get going in different cloud.
@vvuksan in Kazakhstan we not own anything of ourselves. If you are my friend, my availability is your availability, my camel is your camel.
Source in Amazon is tell me they buy Rackspace Cloud and turn it into EBS control plane!
Azamat is disgust of public cloud. He start roll his own, first with custom hardware then custom Linux kernel then custom Gentoo distro.
AWS post-mortem is say EBS outage due to human error. Step #1 for remedy is they not use human in future.
Big winner from EC2 outage is VMWare. They sell real hardware!
In startup we monitor medical equipment. We use combination of #openstack and #cloudfoundry. Survival rate is 29%.
Startup CTO just give order to devops team of build private cloud! He also say use real hardware not what Amazon is use.
Azamat is addict of Russian Roulette. He is tell me only stronger sensation is launch sharded database across multiple cloud.
Azamat is disgust of cloud. For next infrastructure deploy he is use BitTorrent as database layer.
Is of worth point out Kazakhstan government web site is never down during EC2 outage. Is because use 2 DEC VAX in HA configuration.
Azamat is hit of hardest by EC2 outage. He has Web site for dog care product, is already down for more of 1 week in dog years!
Old Kazakhstan proverb say 'He who have most mounted EBS volume at end of day is win!'
@mccrory we are very busy deploy across cloud provider, no time for conference. I recommend VMWorld, is all cloud expert, zero deploy.
Source of Netflix is tell me reason they survive EC2 outage is they buy 3 EC2 zone in bulk and evict all other tenant.
@GeorgeReese is F100 when they say F word 100 time?
For cloud deploy Azamat is recommend inverse rule of 5 nine. If web site is down 99.999% of time, user will be very happy when site is up!
Devops, if site is down today, you need blame yourself and not blame cloud expert! They have absolute nothing of do with cloud deploy!
For avoid cloud problem as today, in startup we deploy infrastructure in RAID5 across cloud provider with EC2 as hot spare.
Azamat is write "Art of Cloud" book. First chapter is on deception. Is start with "All cloud provider profit is base on oversubscription."
Cloud with no API is like Web server listen on 127.0.0.1:80.
@swardley I do cybernetics all day too with my wife.
@swardley @jamesurquhart is cybernetics same as informatics? Is have to do with genome of human yes?
@mgualtieri I not blame Forrester Analyst for want NoOps. Is true Ops is hard! I advise baby step of start learn 'ls'.
@brianshumate not need cloud for Beowulf. In startup we recycle old hardware by run Beowulf on it then Hadoop on top.
In devops we have saying "Fool and his private cloud are soon partitioned".
@wattersjames I know of vmc for long time yes. Now is final work as beta so I can able remove 'alias vmc=ec2-run-instances' from bashrc.
I am slight disappoint of #1 language request for CloudFoundry after Java and Ruby is Visual Basic!
Azamat is got text from wife: "Pizza man is teach me git. Is normal use push more or pull?"
@mrreynolds @roidrage nyet.
@jonnyshare not recognize word Sun. Is computer company?
@roidrage in Kazakhstan home remedy after day of shit work of Perl is sexytime with hot womans.
We launch new product 'Cloud in Van'. Azamat drive van around country, has private cloud in trunk. You use for adhoc MapReduce or DR site.
Before start use IBM Cloud, HP Cloud or Dell Cloud, think for moment of reason why is no Sun Cloud or Compaq Cloud or DEC Cloud.
I hate burst bubble but source in Microsoft is tell me they are buy Rackspace+VMWare. OpenStack/CloudFoundry is run exclusive on VirtualPC.
In devops we need be able do it frontend and backend.
In startup we roll new Web site infrastructure by use OpenCompute+OpenStack+CloudFoundry. Expect launch is 2017. Is cool shit but not work!
Warning! If you deploy CloudFoundry on 1 computer, it go take over all other computer in infrastructure! Is bug in autoscale. #cfoundry
Azamat just deploy CloudFoundry on laptop. It automatically scale to my laptop too! #cfoundry #magic #pixiedust
Still recover from 8 hour of video conference with VMWare cloud team! Big announce soon: VMWare is buy Amazon!
@GeorgeReese in devops we prefer Scala or Clojure. If want learn more programming language I recommend Bloom. Is same stack trace as Ruby!
Azamat is work on Nagios plugin for detect old babushka dig hole with depth more of 1 meter. Is sign Internet might go down in Central Asia.
Next year you will able ssh in Windows machine! For achieve this, Microsoft is buy Canonical and is rename Ubuntu as Windows Cloud Edition.
@wattersjames in Kazakhstan you are know as Cloud Futuramist.
Also in Kazakhstan we have advantage of use green datacenter in abandon uranium mine. Is free fuel, no carbon emission.
In Kazakhstan we do OpenCompute for long time. We use Google approach of cardboard pizza box for server. Hard disk is allow dangle free.
Wa wa wee wa! Kazakhstan government is final manage of hire star in TV Glenn Beck of U S and A! He start in 2 months as rodeo clown!
I am surprise not many people know of phrase "buy Oracle license" is translate exact in Kazakh language as "bend over and take it like man"!
Great success! I manage of launch first instance in IBM public cloud! Welcome screen is bit strange. You know what is z/OS?
@slpsys hybrid cloud expert are get some *mule* shit done.
In DevOps you are either get horse shit done or not. If not, not worry, you can still able qualify as cloud expert.
Source of VMWare is tell me is big announce on 12 April: they are replace Xen as platform of virtualizations in EC2!
@complex I like way you think of DevOps. You would be good culture fit at startup.
In startup we have strict rule of never RTFM unless you need of drive company Lamborghini for first time.
Is true DevOps is first culture then technology. Is why in startup we interview candidate in literature, classical music and ballet.
If SQL not cut it and NoSQL not cut it, is 2 solution:1)roll own BigData self-heal k/v store or 2)fire architect. Most do 3)deploy to cloud.
You have scalability problem? Not worry, good devops always plan of throw away first infrastructure!
In startup we apply rule Azamat has hear from wife: "I never believe of it unless I measure it."
Kazakhstan government is allow CEO of GoDaddy for kill all dangerous camel in our country. In return is free kazakh.gov domain for 2 year.
Scratch surface of cloud expert which say OS is not matter in cloud and you find Microsoft payroll.
For rainy afternoon when life is seem boring, I recommend try install new version of anything on CentOS.
@mtodd @tekkub you are discuss case when github is not blow away production database instead of test, yes?
Devops, you may be tempt play April Fool joke on coworkers by say latest code was push to production. Trust of me, is not at all funny.
I not understand big deal of April Fool Day. In cloud is Fool Day every day!
If application is run very slow, is 2 possibilities: you use laptop, or you use m1.small EC2 instance.
Is easy go from DevOps to NoOps. Is just need make sure you have NoBackups.
For Backup Day Azamat is write article "How build own Cloud drive" for Make magazine. Is involve PERC, 3.5" floppy, S3, USB thumbdrive, SSD.
Azamat is shock of find out his wife is closet debian!
Azamat is consider list EC2 instances as endangered species. He is hope they are spare from sudden death.
Confuse of Dev or Ops? Simple rule: if you are praise for Web site success, you are Dev; if you are blame when Web site down, you are Ops.
In startup we have Casual Friday. Employee are allow bring camel and Windows laptop to work.
Devops good news and bad news! Good news: bubble is back! Bad news: is hard find job in startup if not have excellent ping-pong skill!
@dozba you are true. Same for ebay and paypal.
@swardley @JoeBaguley in Kazakhstan we give refrigerator not certificate to cloud expert. Is for horse meat.
I send Azamat to U S and A for learn Dev from @zedshaw and Ops from @dozba. First task is learn curse word of America.
@swardley not worry, you create list so you are on metadata of list! Azamat say you are always #1 in heart of him!
@swardley I admit I am charlatan in personally! Which are you?
In startup we ask question in interview for devops: "You use Windows at any time?" We assure candidate of answer is strict confidential.
@krishnan please consider of change word Cloud with Compute Utility across of your story. /cc @swardley
Every weekend in startup we let servers catch breath by send all log to /dev/null. Performance during week is improve by 20%!
After try 5 SQL and 8 NoSQL product, Azamat is still search for database. Requirement is not even hard! Is must only have C, A and P.
I am try prove "Microsoft technology is scale at infinite" by induction. Prove of N =&gt; N+1 is very easy. Only problem is N=1 keep do BSOD.
@nnmiller in that case is no project to speak of, so no failure!
Is correlation between word use by devops and project failure rate: "async", "continuous", "eventual", "RoR", "PaaS", "socket", "elastic"
Azamat is run Big Data analytics on famous last words in devops. Most common is "I know, I roll own monitoring tool!"
In startup we have shock offer from @color. They want buy us for 39 million U S Dollar! Good thing CEO not want sell out so cheap.
Advice of Azamat: if want DevOps culture, make of sure not hire Ninja Dev and Pirate Ops!
@pcapr Azamat like! Only observation is try use Perl one-liner more often instead of Ruby!
You can able pop hood open? Is DevOps. You can not able? Is NoOps.
In startup we are work on 5GL language. We estimate go full #NoDev in Q4 2011.
Was not as easy as it sound, but Azamat final manage replace himself with Perl one-liner! Now he is look for job. #NoOps
If ops do dev, user may find serious bug on Web site! If devs do ops, is no Web site for user to find bug!
Azamat is run Hadoop analytics on tweet mention of myself. Interesting fact: if you live in NZ, UK or AU is great chance you hate my joke!
@daveasprey is great of read you start work on cloud infrastructure in 1998! If judge by rest of post, you stop in 2002 yes?
In devops before we can able blog we need of write own blog engine in own Web framework on top of own HTTP server.
@ripienaar @kit_plummer when say 'we', you mean "the needed #devops cultural movement"? I am agree!
Azamat suffer of devops castration anxiety. He is afraid of lose root privilege.
Source at Mozilla is tell me they were able produce only 4 million Firefox 4 browser so hurry if you want download!
In devops we live dangerous. We can be replace at any time with small script!
Great success today! We manage double capacity of public cloud in Almaty Kazakhstan. Is true saying go from 1 to 2 instance is hardest!
@fujin_ why you so angry?
Behind every great devops guy is rejection from hot woman.
Azamat is pine for days when men were men and wrote own device driver. Cloud is slow transform men in wimp!
@wattersjames is very hard break in top 10 cloud expert. Condition include attend 35 conference per year and be in photo with 5 of other 9.
@botchagalupe guy who wrote NoOps post is very confuse. With better command of English language he could be cloud expert (PaaS only).
In devops if shit is not hit fan at least one time each week, it mean you are not try very hard.
Is true ignorance is bliss but in devops it mean Nagios server is down.
Tolstoy's Law of Devops: "Happy server are all alike. Unhappy server are each unhappy in own way". Is why need Ganglia!
Tire of identical server from automated deployment? In startup we offer hand craft server! Is expensive, slow,buggy but is custom for you!
In startup we are tell each server one with most alert is eliminate. Is result in very good reliability and performance!
@swardley I not trust any web site with name start with pee.
Azamat is offer node.js training. Bring laptop. Make of sure you take out hard drive, no disk I/O involved.
Good devops as Azamat is able scale Web farm by 25% in instant! Just send 25% HTTP request to /dev/null.
You can not able choose of create Web product or enterprise product? Is easy! In first case Google is buy you, in 2nd case Oracle.
@mramos29 is 1% inspiration and 99% transpiration. Data center in Kazakhstan not have A/C.
In cloud each VM is compete hard with all others, or at least is die trying.
In startup we roll out infrastructure in RAIC 5 across minimum 3 Cloud provider. 100.0000001% uptime.
Is only top 10 cloud expert in world that can able put BS in EBS.
@wattersjames in Kazakhstan public cloud is network very predictable: 0% packet loss inside, 100% outside. Is vCloud of same?
For disk I/O, if you can not able beat them, join them! (in RAID 0)
Azamat is finish CISSP today. Tomorrow he is already start practice most important lesson: disable telnet on all server!
Cloud expert remember: not attempt actual buildout of infrastructure or you are disqualified! Talk at conference allowed.
Everybody is bash the cloud of lately. In startup we refuse do it!  We prefer zsh.
@mccrory @adrianco @beaker Azamat is very good at security by obscurity. He has method of random change cloud API for confuse hacker.
You have cloud issue? Apply method of 5 Whys, then find human who misconfigured router.
Art of devops war: disable engineer on pager and you disable whole infrastructure.
Is easy come up good name scheme. For app server we use Mike,Mikusya,Mikus,Mikusik,Mikushenka,Mikulya,Mikusha, Mikushka,Mikushenka,Mikochka
For Saint Patrick feast in startup we paint all our Tomcats in green.
Devops: key signing party Saturday in Almaty Kazakhstan! We not only sign PGP but private SSH and SSL key too! You also get offsite backup!
@littleidea if contest is take place west of Moscow then is weak.
@adrianco please consider CTO position at Almaty startup. You have chance of order Azamat around! Pay not good but we are party all time.
When in doubt, denormalize. When doubt is gone, normalize back.
Azamat is back from Sex by Southwest conference.
@DrPrettyBad all of above.
There is no DevOps. Is DevQaOps or DevOpsQa or OpsQaDev or OpsDevQa or QaDevOps or QaOpsDev. Perfect balance is 50/30/20.
In startup we have opening for 1 junior devops. Requirement in-depth knowledge of BGP, Lisp and Dynamo.
In startup we practice Continuous Coding in 3 shift of 8 hour. Is base on observation that quality is able only come out of quantity.
Career advice for devops: avoid technology if is based on acronym! Only safe bet is HTTPS and SSH.
Devops remember, world is not perfect! Otherwise we would have Perl 6, VMWare public cloud and working NoSQL!
In startup we need cut cost at all time. For database as example we not call commit so we save on CPU load, disk I/O and network traffic.
Continuous deployment is to deployment what trainwreck is to train.
@swardley irony is I am doer not thinker. Philosopher is really Azamat.
Cloudy Award is all parody, yes? Then I like! Best is Dyn Inc top IaaS provider!
CloudCamp attendee: is true power struggle in cloud expert circle are solve Bonobo style?
@lnxchk you win me!
Devops guy rule #1: if you see devops friend work on Windows machine, you are not allowed tell anyone.
Of 10 NoSQL product: 4 is not possible install, 3 is crash in 1 day, 2 is freeze server in 1 week, 1 is corrupt data in 1 month.
If I had dollar for every instance I lose in public cloud, I could be able build public cloud.
@dozba if need SQL database you are do it wrong. You only need find + grep + awk + bdb.
Elite writer is use typewriter. Elite devops is use BSD OS.
Windows version is come and go, but Blue Screen Of Death is forever.
@mranney Ganglia for #winning. Now you are owe me 2 healthy ox.
Your application is not of webscale. You start at use coroutine library. Good luck at find cobugs!
Devops not forget what is go around is come around unless you are use SOAP.
If application is not scale just open an Erlang.
When is devops going be open sourced?
Last word of devops guy at startup was "RabbitMQ or die".
Cloud is rarely fail. Is only when datacenter segfaults.
@joe262_ is recursive.
In startup we offer BaaS. Is Blame as a Service, if you use cloud and is fail, you call API and blame is go to us.
@roidrage in Kazakhstan you have choice either go jail or go work for startup do continuous deployment. Most devops are prefer jail.
Devops! Contact of me if interest in work for Big 5 cloud vendor for design Lock-in API!
Is not cloud if is not fail often and hard.
SaaS Builder Guide: 1. Build flaky IaaS. 2. Build PaaS on top, no SLA. 3. Take away of API access.
@swardley @vambenepe I intent not go at Stockholm for accept prize.
If vote on http://cloudcamp.uservoice.com/ take cloud expert score and put - in front. If you propose topic please disconnect from Internet.
You have database problem. You research blog and HN. You start use NoSQL product. Now you not know anymore if you have problem.
You can not able guess what Azamat was able do to his wife last night with Perl one-liner!
PaaS is new Plug and Pray. Plug application in cloud and pray vendor is able scale it.
Windows 7 is sexy OS! In special when Linux is on top of it!
@postwait I am ask you consider Kazakhstan for cloud need. Bandwidth is free, instance is free. We are only take 30% of your profit.
Cloud hybrid is a best of breed! Is less security than private cloud, but it compensate with less scalability than public cloud! #ccevent
#ccevent attendee not forget special event tonight! Top 10 cloud expert in world are mud wrestle naked on stage! May best win! #openstack
Not forget #devopsnights in Kazakhstan next month! What happen there is going stay there!
@littleidea very sorry hear it, is automatic subtraction of 250 point of your cloud expert score.
I can not able count times I was save by Perl one liner. Today I use for unbox 100 Dell server and install OpenStack in less of 15 min!
Is easy go from devops to cloud expert. Is impossible go from cloud expert to devops.
@dkoffler @acroll I LIKE! In Kazakhstan we have best devops and hottest womans (and also other of way around if you are from San Francisco)
@dkoffler @acroll genkuie! What was yell about?
@jeremyhammer is all in eye of beholder.
@ibroadfo is always profound tweet, is depend on receiver to get it. Not worry you are going grow into it.
Devops remember: when job is on the line, only technology invented before 1995 will save of your ass!
In #devops is not what you know, is what you deploy.
Azamat is find perfect use case of NoSQL: is when you not care if you have NoData.
@Werner I warn already of everybody at #ccevent need subtract 200 from cloud expert score. You still have time leave.
@zedshaw is good article for year circa 2002. You heard term devops? I can teach if you want!
Was not aware of #ccevent motto but I like! "You can take cloud expert out of BS talk but you can't take BS talk out of cloud expert!"
Microsoft: "It's not often that we encourage you to stop using one of our products but for #MSOffice we make an exception: docs.google.com"
@GeorgeReese I have tweet capability 24x7 so is not good strategics.
@tnm which are you?
@GeorgeReese insurance is of value when virtual machine is production database no backup.
EC2 is like box of chocolate. You never know what size of instance you are going get available.
@littleidea is true. Is also apply to cloud: if you are not outgrow private cloud, you are not try enough!
Devops remember, always deal with cloud like is no tomorrow!
#ccevent attendee make sure at end of day turn off conference private cloud for save energy. Is private cloud on yes?
@randybias so what you say is Amazon buy all other cloud and make infra standard?
@randybias if use mixtent please subtract 200 from your cloud expert score.
@vambenepe you are rightful! You must have tigerblood.
@ShlomoSwidler I am detect fear in your question. Not worry, you have high enough score that you survive #ccevent. Not repeat though!
@GeorgeReese I am busy manage cloud, can not able do and talk at same time. I believe @cloudsheen is give keynote on Friday.
@ShlomoSwidler speaker is 1 strike, 2 to go from erase of devops guild. #ccevent
After close look at #ccevent schedule, all attendee please subtract 300 from cloud expert score. Devops on pager for cloud instance add 500.
@jtimberman no but you are in the high 200s.
@JoshuaKerievsky in startup Azamat has title Architect so is self understand he is not dangerous enough of code and break build.
All #ccevent attendee please add 100 to your cloud expert score! Everybody else please subtract 100!
How are company run their cloud infrastructure when all cloud expert are attend CloudConnect???
Programming is only fun until build is fail.
@ieure @al3x I am agree. In startup we not use issue tracker. Each developer is start with 5 life and lose 1 life per P0 bug until fired.
ESR law adapted of devops: With enough cloud instance, all deploy bugs are shallow.
In startup we also have contest of best Perl one liner. Winner so far is Azamat for rewrite of Ruby on Rails.
Also at end of month developer with worst bug record is force port app to iPhone.
In startup we keep chart of worst bug of week. Punishment for developer is rewrite code in VBScript for 1 week.
Devops means never have say sorry after deploy.
Is easy write bug-free code. Is what academics do every day! Just remember never release to production.
@randybias I final get it. You want become Edison of cloud!
Not trust Mix Tent! They are startup of nomad asshole Uzbeks!
@GeorgeReese genkuie trust. You are in definite top 10 cloud expert in world. But because of previous tweet you are make top 5!
Devops: if you want become manager, you need forget Unix skill and all language except C#, and most important subscribe InfoWorld!
At party is not always possible be smartest. Is not always possible be hottest. Is always possible say you have biggest private cloud!
We have position open in Almaty startup for garbage collector!
@randybias is what @swardley is say and he is #1 cloud expert in world. Public cloud WINNING!
Devops remember alway follow dream! Unless dream is involve EJB, Oracle, Perl 6, or any Microsoft product.
When CEO is start learn .NET, is time jump ship! #devops
In privatw cloud we offer special Double Or Nothing! You get double number of instance at same price OR all your instance are terminate!
I tell Azamat I am conduct 5 Whys to find root cause of failure. Azamat reply 'Is what she said!'
OpenStack is PHP of cloud.
Size not matter in cloud. Is elasticity matter! #devops
Cloud is overrate. In 5 year you can able run any web site from laptop. You need 2 laptop for HA.
#Devops not forget always wash hand after use cloud!
Galina is say me and Azamat are as Wham! of #devops. Is band so popular in U S and A?
Story like #ie6countdown is inspirational. Genkuie Apple too for #iphone4countdown and #ipad1countdown!
In startup we welcome advocate of continuous delivery by put them on pager. Next they advocate quarterly release.
Big advantage of data center over cloud is you can able conduct safe smoke testing. Remote hand ready with fire extinguisher.
I am so tire of recursion jokes. Azamat is ask me why. Because I am so tire of recursion jokes.
In our startup, first step in continuous deployment is continuous compiling.
How many cloud expert is take change lightbulb? 86400 per day at conservative rate of 1 lightbulb fail every second.
@pandemicsyn @OpenStack I put loud in cloud.
Cloud is the new single point of failure.
NoSQL Magazine is need gear tester! Try out NoSQL product for 1 month and receive 50% off your Oracle license!
@vambenepe as Proust is say: "va te faire foutre, Oracle"!
Oracle has trademark on word SQL! Is mean you have choice of either use DB2, or MyOracle/MS OracleServer/PostgreOracle.
In hipster #devops we use other Perl: Processing, Erlang, R, LaTeX
I work on remake of Leonard Cohen song "Who by FireSheep".
I had of kill sheep of fire of Azamat. I learn lesson: when open socket, make of sure is secure socket! Is easy with node.js.
Hahahahaha DevopsBorat you are pwned!!!! LOL!!!! Is what you get for not use Secure Socket Layer!!!! (Azamat here with Fire The Sheep!!!!)
What is bitchin' mean? Azamat is put "bitchin' rock star from Mars developer" on LinkedIn profile.
Azamat is work on new language code name Oak. Is like C++ but more dumb. Is for cloud, is run everywhere. Oracle has show interest!
Azamat is just send to mentor @b6n live camel for birthday. Mail carrier use cloud and NoSQL yes? If not is not good for camel.
@roidrage @basho congrat on dream job of developer advocate! Is mean you write less code, do less deploy, but talk more in theory yes?
VMWare is soon launch OpenPaaS! Is close to public, invitation only. 22nd lucky caller is get API access!
If it can not be done with find, grep, cut, sed and awk, then is not worth doing.
Little know fact of EC2 instance: every minute they ask themselves "to be or not to be, that is the question"!
In #devops we are forget more Perl syntax in 1 day than non-devops learn in 1 month.
The PaaS Paradox: "PaaS is 250% more scalable than IaaS...25% of the time"
You are not #devops if you not learn 3 web framework, 2 programming language and 1 OS at any give time.
@antirez @moonpilysoft we are also implement fast distributed self-heal key/value store in startup. We call Almaty Water Closet.
We have new hire Galina hot intern for sales in startup. She already push into Prod! Guy Prod is QA manager, he like push very much!
Not forget fundraising for #devops in Almaty Kazakhstan! We are have sale of bake Windows PC!
From collection of #devops poem: "A database by any other name / Would still be owned by Oracle"
Azamat is practice Mild Programming. Is 10% code, 2% test and 88% check twitter and HN.
Why adopt cloud in your company? Shit is have more fans to hit!
We have 3 for 2 deal in Kazakhstan cloud every day! You pay for 3 instance and get 2 back.
@ShlomoSwidler you are cloud wizard. I ask only for 20% cut of money you make, is better of Apple or Facebook with 30%.
Source in Google is tell me they begin cut cost. First step is outsource MapReduce operation to Yahoo server farm which are run Hadoop.
For get job at @banksimple need be proficient in JBash, JRuby, JPython and JPerl. Prior Java experience is consider minus.
@mperham we had event in Kazakhstan but it take only 4 second because we use node.js.
Very nice! Scala win Oscar for best Java language!
Azamat has camel can able predict Oscar winner. For this year she pick Oracle.
Azamat was invite for Oscar red carpet. He can not able go because today he is of pager duty rotation. #Devops
2 option for success of startup: hire team of 1 architect, 5 dev, 2 QA, 2 ops; or hire team of 1 Internet Jedi Samurai Jason Calacanis
@robinbowes genkuie mild compliment. You not dig Kazakh humor of too much?
To make error is human. To propagate error to all server in automatic way is #devops.
@roidrage I am write book on how fail fast and hard in variety of distribute system. Is call "Crime and punishment in a distributed world".

@dmz006 CloudAudit is standard body for 6 Asses API. Look on cloudaudit.org for detail. Is very easy understand, is nothing there.
@georgevhulme @GeorgeReese good news! We are implement CloudAudit for Kazakhstan govt private cloud. We are start with A #4: ASSES
Law of the elastic: in #devops is nothing as hard as can not be solve with 25 more cloud instance.
In #devops first goal is build character. Is why we observe manly rule "Fail Hard": if is worth failing, is worth failing hard.
@kchodorow is true rumor CouchDB team is contribute durability layer to MongoDB codename FinallySleepWellAtNight?
@kchodorow you know we deploy MongoDB autoshard for Kazakhstan govt? Is work 90% time but some time is create shard for asshole Uzbeks.
In #devops we are always seek efficiency ruthless. Is because it is allow us have more sexytime. Is not possible if use Windows though.
Not forget next week DevCampAstana! We are work on new distributed NoSQL codename Haiku. One thing sure is going to be C base.
@xagile you are confuse. You not need puny microwave oven in 1st place. Is need think big as industrial forge. Is how empire is win.
@GeorgeReese you are remind me of geraldo, kazakhstan version.
@moonpolysoft is right. This devops_shit_cloud_borat_evangelist thing is get old. I am think retire while on top.
@Beaker I am not able parse reply from you. You take drug?
In Kazakhstan #devops training is like military. First need get humiliated broken spirit by use Windows, then become real man of Unix.
@bitfield genkuie info on why puppet is best. One question: how many server you deployed with puppet vs chef?
@Beaker as Cisco/cloud expert you predict Cisco buy VMWare or VMWare buy Cisco? I need know for Kazakhstan govt cloud strategy.
@michaelbolton is good then. Make sure all server are happy like that. If need job after we have many opening in Astana.
@michaelbolton you are not #devops if think metrics not legitimate on own. Try ask server why it is think CPU 100% not good for itself.
In Kazakhstan we not use foursquare/gowalla/facebook places because is go against old tradition of use dog urine when check in new place.
@obfuscurity @bitfield is easy comparison chef vs. puppet. Chef is use Ruby turing complete language; puppet is use puppet.
Less know truth of programming: is not matter if use events or threads. Database is bottleneck.
@planetclaire9 yes I am volunteer party organize at #agile2011. I hear men take off pants at #agile2010. Is shame! Why not womans too???
@martiboheme and Kazakh good language for #devops. As example Django is means cunning gypsy in Kazakh language.
Less know truth of programming: if you never program in C are jump direct to Java is like you never learn cook you only heat microwave.
@mperham in Kazakhstan neckbeard is only for show sign manhood. Of Unix skill we have 1 day of prove how implement Apache in bash.
@obfuscurity you try already password p@$$w0rd? Is use of default in all Unix server setup of @opscode.
@mattokeefe you are use battery as metaphor for left testicle yes?
Less know truth of programming: all good programmer is use C in his 20, Lisp in his 30 and have Ferrari and hot wife at 40.
Less know truth of programming: laptop heat of CPU is make you impotent. Azamat is suffer of it. Solution is use cloud all time.
Diaspora team is have PHP/SQLite prototype allow you add 3 friend before crash. They are hire me scale to cloud. Goal for 2011 is 30 friend.
One good thing of #devops: is all culture. Everybody can able do it, is not need technical background.
In Kazakhstan Oracle license is easy, is depend how many OS you kill. Is 1 Oracle Ent. license for 50 Windows or 100 Linux or 1000 Android.
@vambenepe of http://is.gd/esk52 : you are second after @strlen tell me go fuck myself. Is not nice!
@ezmobius @roidrage for lots cloud capacity use Central Asia region Kazakhstan + Uzbekistan. Friend @GeorgeReese has entratus cloud there.

@fxlv genkuie follow! I am have many friend in Tallinn Latvia!
@gyehuda genkuie explain Hadoop in 1/2 tweet. Compute-grid technology is Beowulf yes? You need cloud or NoSQL for Hadoop?
How many OpenSolaris user is take now to change lightbulb? Is lucky is 1 user left in world! @bcantrill
Bad news! Is not possible implement dtrace on Windows. Microsoft is say is constitute sexual harassment.
In NoSQL evaluation I do for Kazakhstan govt is very close race between Redis of Basho and CouchDB of 10gen.
@atmos congrat! When you are hand lemon, drinkup lemonade!
@vambenepe not set hope too high
They laughed when I sat down to learn #openstack. But when I started to implement private/hybrid/public cloud!
@gbarrancos you must not be #devops if say not fuck with production. Is what we do all day. Sometime it is fuck back.
@GeorgeReese I am understand now what is hybrid cloud! Is when run out of space in rack at data center and expand in enstratus yes?
In #devops is no shame to be idempotent.
@gyehuda so for serious question: what yahoo studs I need follow on twitter?
@gyehuda I am not surprise you ask about how get brand recognition. After all you work for Yahoo.
@antonyfalco I am some sad you find @strlen tweet more funny of mine. I am think is not about me though, is about you.
@strlen is good you clarify.So you are tell me go fuck myself.Is good I have #devopsdraft team can do any thing.You know cloud or NoSQL?
@strlen I am confuse.You say I need implement distributed memoization Y-comb in Erlang?Or you just say I need go fuck myself?
I work on Facehunchdora.com.Is only allow you choose friend if other users like that person.Can only listen music your friends listen to.

@michaelbolton in devops is either intelligent or hilarious. I have none but I am rich.
@patrickdebois what you use to ship deployment instruction as code? I am teach Azamat always create clean sandbox before install: rm -rf /
@michaelbolton you are read me like book.
@banksimple devops team: 1)lots sexytime due new status stud; 2)less sexytime due API design meeting;3)no sexytime due production launch
@ShitMyDevOpSays you win me. I need stop tweet learn more.

@tnm8 is latency from U S and A to my country.
Test #6 for fail of Open Source project: network code is like mongrel2 is only work on localhost.
@philiph genkuie aim for please. In agile I am learn is user feedback very important. Are which tweet bore you?
@obfuscurity friendly in Kazakhstan is only some sexytime but more hold hands.
I was very surprise when friend Igor Sysoev call tell me nginx in Russian language is mean F U ZED. Is true?
I am think join good nice Open Source project. Is true OpenBSD is have friendly leader tight group developer?
@randybias we have legend in devops when RAM stick is fail we put under pillow and cloud fairy is make server self heal until morning.
@allspaw genkuie reply, is honor. Is not look count with lady, is #devops Stud factor. I am maybe 6.5 of 10, you are 11.
@vcloudinsdr is true I get very excite of puppet/chef/cfengine3/bcfg2. You need try some time. You work in cloud yes?
@VanessaAlvarez1 genkuie I like meet you too. We not have hottie infrastructure girl in Kazakhstan. What conference are you attend?
I am hope you not do backup to tape anymore. We are use disk backup on all server. Each #devops is wear designer USB stick necklace.
For Kazakhstan govt disaster recovery we have 2 private cloud different area geography each self heal each other. Is like 69 in the cloud.
@cscotta we offer hosting very cheap in Kazakhstan. Start at $1/month. Use cloud so we still make lot money.
@GeorgeReese genkuie info on windows of enstratus. Is explain why all population asshole Uzbeks are work as sysadmin enstratus.
I am busy learn R. Is new NoSQL. I hear chick are dig it.
@cscotta is interested you are mention mongodb.I have wet dream of it last night with autosharding and self heal.Is better of couchdb yes?
@mgodave is good you have at least devops humor read all day.
@agilinajulie genkuie follow. I am look forward do some extreme program with you.
@tnm8 HIGH FIVE! Now is time go back RESTFUL API. Azamat is study REST here is iron rule: not use verb in URL.
@tnm8 what it matter RESTFUL or not. Step back look big picture. You have sexytime with @triciahelfer? Is what matter.
Cloud #devops ideal: "Sitting quietly, doing nothing, launch comes, and the infrastructure grows by itself"
@fitnessblowout genkuie follow. Why your branch in Astana is call @fitnessblowjob? I not understand U S and A jargon.
@lnxchk so is true linux chicks are dig @allspaw!
Clone horse startup is use latest technology as Parallel Lisp in cloud. No need database code is data and data is code.
I am consult for new startup in Astana is in clone horse industry. Goal is obtain White Horse directly of mare (1/2 milk of mare 1/2 vodka)
If you work on cloud good self help exercise is repeat 10 times at morning "I can teach @swardley some thing today" (in true you will not)
Self help exercise for #devops: at morning look mirror say 10 times "I can be like @allspaw".
@tnm8 never of mind. I tell @triciahelfer follow you, she is just did it. You are owe me of big time.
@ohlol is joke funny in U S and A? In Kazakhstan joke is dirty. Is like yak guy shave himself and drink coffee have sexytime with cougar.
@CloudCEO I would be honor. Meat of bear is suppose be so strong aphrodisiac is make all your cloud instance stay up forever.
@ohlol not have idea but I like good riddle. Is why?
@CloudCEO genkuie. I mean ask forgot: you are brother of Nugent guitar star? Is very famous in Kazakhstan like Engelbert Humperdink.
@vambenepe sorry I not understand jargon. We eat peanut dip in milk of mare. Is good aphrodisiac.
@ohlol you are need more cultural learning. Apple, peanut and coffee first grow Kazakhstan steppe. Also yak and cougar.
@tnm8 eat heart out: newest follower of Stud from Kazakhstan is @triciahelfer. What you pay for me allow you DM her?
Launch cloud instance is like eat peanut: test how strong will of stop you have.
Be master of cloud not be mastered by cloud. #devops #chef #puppet
Before continuous deployment: chop wood, carry water. After continuous deployment: chop wood, carry water. Only stop if Nagios alert.
@corbinbs high five! You use continuous deployment?
@lisacrispin for keep donkey picture in Kazakhstan we are use USB thumb or Flickr. I can able send Azamat for show how.
@sergiosalvi look at bright side. You could able been a Noracler. Wait! Maybe is can still happen!
Test #5 for fail of Open Source project: all unit test pass on local box developer, install is vomit with fail dependency everywhere else.
@mshuler high five "fauxpen source"! Are you born Europe? American reader is not get your joke.
@vambenepe is sad progress. Soon you are receive short SMS '!tonite'.
@joedamato @strlen I am confuse. Your husbands are gay?
@OpenStack genkuie follow. Is good see Open Source project not have enterprise ready in docs.
@ubuntusoren dependency is good however iron rule: # of dependency &gt; N =&gt; uninstallable
@DazWorrall glad you like puppet book. You also need read "Hell's Kitchen: Cooking With Chef" is publish Apress in November.
@tnm8 I am think I write django ORM for all NoSQL flavor. It can not able be that bad. I present on videoconference at djangocon.
@tnm8 also I am little dissapoint you write lame blog engine for django dash. Even Azamat is able do that.
@dozba all SQL company are fuck now. Is why we use NoSQL everywhere.
@GeorgeReese I am get it now. Is high need for budget automation tool. I am try write one for djangocon. Is enstratus interest sponsor work?
@tnm8 I am not care Kazakh princess. I have Tricia Helfer sexytime.
@GeorgeReese I am not use Java anymore. Not want get sued.
@tnm8 genkuie. 4 out of 10, better than nothing.
@tnm8 I am still wait for docstring exemplify.
@GeorgeReese is enstratus budget tool able put together budget too? Is hardest step. I would like automate.
@williamlouth in devops we never use single cloud, is like SPOF. When one cloud over expense limit use other with better APR.
For #devops why are we say 'Infrastructure As Code'? Is not better 'Code As Infrastructure'?
Test #4 for fail of Open Source project: free version is offer limit feature compare to paid enterprise version.
@jimshreds if you not like vi @hunch is say you also not like Unix. You are Vista user?
@obfuscurity I am definitely rule out reconnoiter. Is it even possible install?
I have question: if dev can not really able ops and ops can not really able dev, then what is devops do?
@vambenepe is good. For a moment I was thought you work for Oracle.
How much dev would a devops ops if a devops could ops dev?
@vambenepe I am confuse. Are you work for Oracle or are you sexual harass by Oracle?
I am much ask "devops_borat how can you be so fucking funny?". Is easy: I am put horse bologna in shoe so I feel funny.
Test #3 for fail of Open Source project: step of install operating system is easy part.
Test #2 for fail of Open Source project: is need install more of 5 other Open Source project as dependency.
Test #1 for fail of Open Source project: check if word "enterprise ready" is appear in docs.
@ericflo congrat servertail project. Is very useful for Kazakhstan government. I am send you login info for read logs all server in cloud.
@ericholscher I am hate rain on django dash parade but in #devops nobody read fucking docs.
I like very much milk of mare and horse meat. Is good aphrodisiac for #devops when need stay up all night. For apply Windows patch reboot.
@swardley is all of market share. Give away to take away later.
@joedamato all sister are date russian oil natural gas billionaire. #devops is a shit.
I am relieve for Azamat design decision not base his script language Kaban on JVM. He is use Parrot VM. Kaban is soon ready around 2025.
@moonpolysoft genkuie follow. Can you able prove you are not same me?
@joedamato is hard make end meet? Almaty University is offer teaching position + new mbp for all employee. Must know Ruby.
@charlottepeace is best understand my tweet when you are not on drugs. Are you same with Apple commercial stoned girl?
@lisacrispin you know donkey is like beer very much too? Donkey of Azamat is able program Ruby after drink 1 bucket beer.
Kazakhstan government is deploy new "green" cloud. Is take only 30% electricity compare traditional. Is open 9 AM - 3 PM.
@tnm8 genkuie refer Tricia Helfer. Is she girlfriend DHH?
@gevaperry genkuie follow. What advice you have for cloud enterprise software? I am think kvm, is good enough?
@tnm8 word of advice: please spare pain and just port django dash app to rails. Will be ready in 20 min.
@mperham is very easy answer: Rails + cloud = Twitter fail whale.
@allspaw if devops can not able respond to nagios alert in Kazakhstan we give impotence remedy tiger testicle in milk of mare.
@markimbriaco I am surprise you need editor visually. In devops we use ed. If lazy or tire we reach for sed awk.
@kylegato cloud in U S and A is IaaS PaaS SaaS. In Kazakhstan is DaaS. We not have information highway use Donkey instead.
In news today is JVM can not be able downloaded anymore. Is only available as iPhone app.
Also for cloud strategy apply @swardley rule of 'Nothing New Under The Sun': all of cloud is already cover in 1966 utility computing book.
When think of cloud strategy apply @GeorgeReese rule of 'They Always Come In 3s': make sure you use private cloud, or public, or hybrid.
I can not able compete @swardley and @GeorgeReese on Cloud knowledge so I am compete on price. Free consultation for anybody ask question!
@GeorgeReese I understand. Is nothing be ashame of. DHL is have local branch in Almaty, is offer good benefit.
@GeorgeReese you are world traveler as in Jules Verne book. I am only know Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. You work for CIA?
@zedshaw please also prove @moonpolysoft is not same as me. Is annoy some people are think it.
@GeorgeReese also at Almaty Cloud conference attendee split in team for build cloud in abandon uranium mine. Is good heal all allergy.
@GeorgeReese I am invite you at Almaty conference for Cloud in Sept. Is hand on: all attend need build mini cloud. What cloud you know best?
I have theory on lactose intolerable and other allergy for devops in U S and A. Is lack of exposure to uranium radiation as Chernobyl.
@tnm8 you are good developer and good human. I repay. I send you cheese of milk of mare by post. Is not able go bad.
@tnm8 in Kazakhstan when code 24x7 is recommended milk of mare for fortify. You have in U S and A? Is best when you milk mare on own hand.
@tnm8 you have keep promise work my name in django dash yes?
@ohlol I am not blame you. ColdFusion is good solid product. Is like Perl for web frameworks. Rails is like VisualBasic.
@moonpolysoft also I can able start GitHub topic if you like.
@tnm8 I have hear Django guys are fucker flaky and not know how get requirement. I am contact Rails guys maybe they can help.
@moonpolysoft no that was all of Oracle. I am need find new topic. Have idea?
I am force boycott ex-friend Larry Ellison. No more MIG jet fighter flying, no more America Cup yachting. He is need stop behave as brat!
@moonpolysoft I hear you are start new "Oracle" plan on GitHub unlimited private repositories for Oracle if they promise not sue. Is true?
@tnm8 is done deal. See @antonyfalco for free riak enterprise license. They give away for free if Oracle promise not sue them.
@tnm8 you play ball hard in U S and A. I see what I can do. If only you need MySQL enterprise would be easy, I am friend Larry Ellison.
@tnm8 I would be honor if you could able work name DEVOPS_BORAT in your Django Dash app. I return favor somehow.
@RonJeffries is @marick was think that, not me. I am also surprise @marick is think Google is God. Could be.
@marick then at least you will be martyr, is not bad.
I am sick tire of Oracle news. Is last one then I boycott. Oracle is sue Disney due to Sleeping Beauty was use cup of Java for wake up!!!
@marick you are on slippery slope. Clojure -&gt; JVM -&gt; Oracle. You have much money to defend?
@ohlol not tell me you are power user of powershell?! In all case powershell is easy replace with ColdFusion on top JVM.
Larry Ellison is use strange words in memo to Oracle execs. Why he say 'Google is doubleplusungood"???
@ohlol is not all bad news for OS. You will still able use Windows. However next version of Windows is base JVM because Oracle is sue .NET.
@swardley I am worry you will have write of only 1 Cloud company soon. Read first words of http://bit.ly/b0qKBB - "pioneering" is keyword.
Sad news. Is no OSCON next year. Is call ORACLECON.
Oracle Ministry of Truth is want Twitter hand over my account! They want change to ORACLE_BORAT, replace Oracle with Google in all tweet!

Enough Oracle joke. Now serious research of Soviet Academy: are 3 type company in the world:1)sued by Oracle; 2)owned by Oracle;3)Oracle
Is this joke??? Larry Ellison is sue NoSQL! He is say SQL in NoSQL is belong to Oracle patent.
I have nauseated: Oracle is now compete with Facebook too. They just bought domain facepalm.com.
Wa wa wee wa! Oracle is now say they put the Java in Javascript!!!
More confusion: is not OpenStack part of Open Solaris? What is become of it then?
NOT play 'guess letter I am think' game with Larry Ellison! He is know what letter you are think: J, V and M.
Now I am very confuse. Oracle is hire @scobleizer as Java evangelist AND they sponsor @scobleizer dancing baby app in Android Market???
I am confuse. Google is now rewrite Android in Rails????
News break! Larry Ellison is give MIG fight jet to Linus Torvalds for rewrite kernel in Java.
Larry Ellison is want Oracle port Ubuntu to Solaris 11. He is say is all same fucking shit, is all run on top of JVM.
Oracle is hire like mad in Kazakhstan. They are need lots of programmer for rewrite Google in Java.
@moonpolysoft you like riak? We are build RCS Hub on riak backend and self heal wiki.
How many Open Solaris user is take change lightbulb? IS NOT FUNNY I KNOW.
Important lesson #agile2010 always use technology of Japan name. Is why I introduce Basho Riak in startup. Is also own by Oracle?

@GeorgeReese joke is very new in Kazakhstan. Is may be old in U S and A. We are at least 20 year behind. With strong #devops hope catch up.
@GeorgeReese here joke to light mood: how many cloud expert it take change light bulb? Can not change, can only give advice on how change.
Law of #devops monitoring: if use open source monitoring system, it evolve until it can be replace by Nagios plugin
Also Azamat is find unit test is bulls shit. Is no need when write NoSQL database which is self heal.
Azamat is make a good progress on script language Kaban. Is now event based. He is rewrite CouchDB in Kaban next.
@jamesurquhart @rosy1280 is law of #devops cloud AI: is no AI in cloud, #devops have need use own brain.

@GeorgeReese I am confuse. "Use private or public cloud" is true logic value itself. Why rest of the article?
@GeorgeReese genkuie post of private cloud security. I am think your conclusion is "use private or public cloud". Is accurate?
Friend in U S and A industry of TV is tell me Scott McNealy is play main part in 'Last Comic Standing". Is true?

@AlTobey @CloudCEO for #devops all is need 5 things: 1) public/private cloud; 2) ruby/python; 3) chef/puppet; 4) NoSQL; 5) tweet 35% time
@CloudCEO I am not suprise #ArchCamp out of idea for tool of cloud. Is Arch in title mean architect? That is explain. You need #devops.
@ripienaar is also Python comes with include battery. Next version is include Django.
#devops  tactics and strategy. Tactics is how optimal reboot Windows servers after patch install. Strategy is replace Windows with Unix.
@philiph is OK he/she has fool Azamat too. Azamat is like very much pour any things down of leg.
@markimbriaco nice luck for new job. In Kazakhstan we say 'may camel never thirst'. Is Heroku hire you for event-base NoSQL? See node.js.
@antonyfalco Bolivar is fashion of old. In our startup we share steed for pair programming, is very efficient.
@accesshosting genkuie for follow. I not have suspect MS Access is use outside Kazakhstan. Is warm for heart. You are let @tnm8 knows yes?
@FrancescoC plucked chicken is cheap, we give to intern. For industry expert as you we offer live camel or small donkey troop.
@CloudCEO I am interest hear continuous deployment discussion.  Is strange, I not knew Cloud has CEO. You need Cloud Devops?
@tnm8 I not want CouchDB use MS Access, I use on own for new Riak backend. I am try convince MS branch in Almaty of open source Access.

@voodootikigod is twitter in flame because announcement couchdb is rewrite in node.js. I LIKE VERY MUCH!

@fujin_ Azamat he is know #opscode #opschef #ruby #devops #sysadmin #msaccess #visualc++ #vista #sqlserver2000 #msexchange. Is OK if he DM?
I have friend Jimmy in U S and A, he call tell me: "In #devops we do it 24x7"
@sippndipp my horse is your horse, your Rails server my Rails server. You are true of mustache, is sign of manliness yes.
@strlen you are make 2 mistake: 1) stalin is still supreme ruler Russia; 2) is not C in Soviet #devops, is Cobol
Is good discussion on Twitter on distributed database write in C. Not understand, is very subtle. Why not use javascript all way down?
@tnm8 in Kazakhstan saying 'not count donkey before hatch'. We start MS Access, only then MS SQL Server.
@tnm8 is fun you mention event-drive framework. We are work on it at Kazakhstan startup. Is all javascript, we think call it mode.js.
In Kazakhstan startup is tester shot Taser if customer find bug first. Is same in U S and A? We have many intern use as tester. #devops
#ff @DEVOPS_BORAT @ShitMyDevopSays @DBAHULK @DEVOPS_BORAT @ShitMyDevopSays @DBAHULK @DEVOPS_BORAT @ShitMyDevopSays @DBAHULK @DEVOPS_BORAT
Also with continuous integration we are do push to production in instant. If fail is Arduino kill donkey. Azamat has kill 23 donkey so far.
For Continuous Integration in startup we port crontab to Rails and run build. We have Arduino too is pull donkey tail yell when bad checkin.
If work as tester in Kazakhstan is not fair, only paid 1 sheep. Architect paid 1 camel and #devops paid 1 donkey. Is same in U S and A?
@jtroyer is fact that #devops &gt; #virtualization. Not need @v12n_borat then.
@jmhodges is @moonpolysoft Kazakhstan #devops? If no, he can not able be me.
I am confuse: is VMworld community conference or is organize by Citrix? Is not clear from homepage.
Revise #devops work day: 45% stare fail whale; 35% read blog; 10% dream infrastructure is scalable; 5% look Apple product online; 5% do shit
@FrancescoC I agree full of Twitter downtime. Is bulls shit. Azamat is rewrite clone in Erlang though. He may need consulting if you can.
Compute on envelope's back say Twitter clone is handle Central Asia traffic with 2 server. Is big territory, few people. Rails should be OK.
Azamat is sick of whale fail, is write Twitter clone in modern technology: cloud, NoSQL, erlang, clojure, ZeroMQ. Is for Central Asia only.
@vambenepe in #devops not need many hour sleep, is self organizing. Also if carry pager you not sleep for 1 week, need watch infrastructure.
@mramos29 is easy judge book by cover when is animal cover by Tim O'Reilly.
Wa wa wee wa! I not realized how much depend on Twitter here in Kazakhstan. Is not good when it go down, maybe it need use cloud and NoSQL?
In #devops we *can* able judge book by cover.
In #devops we *can* able judge book by cover.
@tnm8 I have use early version MS Access 1993. Was very good, easy create GUI too. Is good hear of NoSQL on it. I remember read Riak use it?
Is true Microsoft Azure cloud based on Virtual PC? Or was it JumpBox?
At #bizconf I recommend bickering talk 3 PM. Is on how destroy self organizing team. Is like pull network cable out of MongoDB server.
@damienkatz genkuie link asshole architect. In University I was teach do inverse of 5 rules. Was during Soviet time, was no #devops culture.
For cloud are you recommend gigabit network? Am think ask Bekzat network guy upgrade 3COM switch from 10/100 MB.
@obfuscurity also is what @surgecon? In Kazakhstan surge is when power go out. It happen very much, is why need self heal cloud and NoSQL.
@obfuscurity genkuie @surgecon invite. I am think of it. It depend on schedule of NoSQL implementation for Kazakhstan government.
I wish I able go #bizconf. From first day schedule I like go 'box lunch'. I have never see boxing in lunchtime. I think Obie Fernandez win.
Our startup CTO is put sign in office so #devops read and stay in #devops: "higher monkey climbs tree, more you can able see his ass".
Wa wa wee wa! MongoDB 1.6.0 out have autosharding. I am try on new servers I have buy from local Compaq branch. Autoshard is autoheal yes?
I read of MongoDB durability issue. What is problem? If database is corrupting it not matter so much, nobody is use in production anyway.
I have hear VMWare buy Redis and start sell as VMSQL. Is true? Is cheaper than Cassandra of Riptano?
@igrigorik genkuie for find tip. I tell Azamat of it. He know rm -rf already but not combine with find yet. Is good NoSQL can heal self.
@jtimberman I am suprise of you use sudo. In #devops culture everybody is know root password but nobody is use it. #publickeyssh
#devops work day: 35% read tweet; 20% write tweet; 15% read blog; 15% meeting; 10% dream infrastructure is scalable; 5% do some shit
@Obdurodon I agree in full with RedHat is linux not synonym for Ubuntu. In #devops we know better is linux actually Debian.
@solarce genkuie. Not know what poignant mean, I am hope is good. In my language mean some like horse stud.
@cscotta genkuie! Is open of eye. You are good #devops. Any time you want job, let me know. Plenty of sexytime in Kazakhstan.
@cscotta genkuie FTP idea. Is not same as telnet right?
@ajsharp what you recommend replace S3? SAN or NAS?
@ShitMyDevOpSays what type DVCS you recommend for #devops? In Kazakhstan we have RCS, almost as git, only more old and reliable.
@vambenepe genkuie tip on Prop 8. Now I am think I understand. Is what in Kazakhstan we call 'bromance' yes?
Is somebody please explain noise on Prop 8? Is what Prop 8? Can I have cultural learning?
Is me only or is Google Wave have remind of Microsoft Bob?
@dimacus if you want relocate Kazakhstan, we have Unix position open. Requirement is 3 or more NoSQL product knowledge. Is plenty sexytime.
@jrecursive genkuie for cultural learning of Cassandra. Is myth figure full of tragedy, no? Not good omen for Kazakhstan govt. NoSQL deploy.
@dimacus for high blood pressure of Active Directory I recommend replace of LDAP + Samba. Is what we do in #devops to be able have sexytime.
@tnm8 is good hear. You know Star Trek was launch from Kazakhstan? Is from Baikonur. Also Mark Shuttleworth launch there.
@timbray genkuie for follow. You know we have statue of you in Almaty? Is inscription 'Father of XML'. Is next to RMS statue.
Is true Cassandra grow itself in cloud and heal itself? I read of tolerance to faults, it say can rebuild itself after nuclear war. Is true?
@botchagalupe I am sorry you are block me from twitter. I would be 2000 follower. Why you say devops != scripts? Is Azamat work waste then?
Azamat make progress in script language Kaban. Is possible read file contain Қазақстан by use backtick `cat file`. Is better than Ruby 1.9.1
Wa wa wee wa! I was think all NoSQL product have same API, as SQL only no join. I need learn each NoSQL for itself? Is bulls shit.
@swardley I am honor by compliment but is true #devops are #4 after industry expert, CTO and chief architect. #5 is tester.
@swardley genkuie. We not have any you describe in Kazakhstan. You are far over head of me. I do #devops, that's all it.
For NoSQL product I am look combination Cassandra, MongoDB and Redis. Each a type of rabbit warren. I am think is cunning. You like choice?
@zedshaw Jagshemash. I know I bore is because I not use sexytime word anymore. I am leave it to you. Is also code speak for itself. Rock on.
I am research NoSQL product for Kazakhstan govt. You know saying "cunning rabbit has 3 warren"? Is why I look for 3 product use same time.
@swardley is what you direct attention on during day? I like very much to do same if possible. I wish it is NoSQL, yes?
I am achieve zen mind by stare at @zedshaw twitter avatar. Is black pitch or is wave subtle in it? Can not tell, but I feel very gladness.
@jtimberman Jagshemash. I also have drink 2 type milk of mare today: Jabe and Adaev. I high recommend Adaev if you can able try.
In Kazakhstan good manner is ask person you meet about health of livestock first. In #devops same, need ask of server CPU utilization first.
@ampledata are you test splunk? Full version is cost same 15 camel in Kazakhstan. Free version is choke on my 1 GB syslog.
Law of eliminate bottleneck: is always the database. Also ask @DBAHULK.
Borat law of disk for #devops: disk always get full because of log. Is like boil milk of mare, always happen when you not look.
Cultural learning #devops: is Microsoft buy Twitter? Old Kazakhstan proverb say no: "in vain is .NET spread in sight of bird"
Old Kazakhstan proverb: Blessed is the mother who gives birth to a #devops.
@vambenepe what you ask is Cloud fallacy #6: committee is able make cloud standard with no actual implementing. Is story of OSI 7-layer.
Cloud fallacy #5: cloud is make your application scalable. Is like say 9 cows can produce 1 calf in 1 month.
@zeddsdead genkuie NoSQL explain. I understand all except word 'standard'. Are you Oracle guy?
@jtimberman is what Caps you talk about? I have hear REST yes.
@obfuscurity you laugh but dump in memory + iterate is exactly what I am do.
I am final understand NoSQL: is 1 value for 1 key, is scale infinite. I am have only 1 question: how I do join?
I am understand No in NoSQL. I am not understand SQL in NoSQL. #devops
@vambenepe I love you too, but like brother only OK? Not Bruno style.
Azamat is make good progress on script language Kaban. He is now have white space significant. #devops
@dkubb compiler theory is horse shit. I have study at University never use it. For #devops all need is Unix lemur book and @ShitMyDevOpSays.
@ShitMyDevOpSays my lips stretch is show my naked teeth (is Kazakh poetic for LOL)
Cloud not need sysadmin actually 1/2 true. Need sysadmin of special power as a bull able make penetrate whole cow farm. Is called #devops.
Cloud fallacy #4: not need sysadmin. Is like say in cow farm not need human take care. Is cow milk herself?
Cloud fallacy #3: sum of human knowledge on #cloud is @swardley + @jamesurquhart
Cloud fallacy #2: if read many article and tweet on cloud from cloud experts then is very easy understand and deploy cloud.         NOT!
@strlen genkuie for trust in presenting skill. I work on it very much. I work on fallacy of cloud. #1 easy: OpenStack is game changer.
Friend from Kazakhstan government call say they also use Continuous Deployment in healthcare. Interesting stat: mortality rate up only 9.6%
In our startup with #continuousdeployment is engineer fired if not deploy to prod 8 time/day. Rest of time must spent talk angry customer.
I have start apply Continuous Deployment in Astana startup. Is very easy, no need QA/test team. Push to prod. then take call from customer.
Is saying in Kazakhstan "not put cart before horse". In #continuousdeployment it mean not test before deploy to production. Is make easy!
I am learn Continuous Deployment of Eric Ries blogs. He used apply it for IMVU now he not work there anymore. Why?
Aibat is return from #defcon. He say he had sexytime in Las Vegas with 2 cougars. Is possible? Is not puma attack kill human?
@joshowens Jagshemash. I am very open of infrastructure. Ask any question you like and I contribute your podcast.
@ShitMyDevOpSays I am get worry see no tweet from you. You too busy with #devops? Remind that true #devops is spend 35% time on tweet.
@portertech I am true happy you like Gentoo. Is also prefer OS of Azamat. He say all other Linux flavor should call Wimpy Buttercakes Linux.
@philiph is @ericp98 good #devops? Is he want relocate Kazakhstan? We are hire in Rails startup. We give 1 camel to promise new hire.
@obie genkuie for RubyConf remind. Will submit proposal on Rails use cases in glorious nation of Kazakhstan. Will try have @dhh present it.
@Ubuntuka is why in #devops always run everywhere as root. In #devops culture is much of a trust. Sudo is insult.
Microsoft branch in Almaty call say they offer 50% off their new NoSQL product code name Bob. I am tempting try.
I have new startup in Astana. We make new site is call DevopsBook. Is for devops to be friend and share photo of Apple product they own.
Aibat went Ninja party last night at #defcon. Was 2 woman and 354 man. Was pool party but no sex no alcohol, all too busy crack password.
Great success! Aibat win Crack Me If You Can prize at #defcon!He is crack 52768 of 53000 password.Was easy with private cloud in Kazakhstan.
@obie in final example I in person use Rails for site like 'Am I Hot Or Not' but for #devops. Is in alpha now. You would be vote very hot.
@obie also in Kazakhstan #devops use Rails for web apps for donkey farm management. Is food rations compute and assign to donkey in Rails.
@obie hello from glorious nation of Kazakhstan for Rails book you work. All startup in Astana is oblige use Rails, is not allow use Django.
Also dmtf.org site is very easy use. All link open PDF document. Is like Kazakhstan government site too. I LIKE!
I am read DMTF cloud standard document. I have English not good sufficient, but I understand a bits. In a nut's shell, is same CORBA.
I am work with Bekzat network guy on cloud standards. We not get why so much fuss. Is need be based on OSI 7-layer. Will publish soon.
Azamat is make nice progress on his new script language Kaban. Is able now assign number to variable without segfault. #devops #ftw
Today I deploy MongoDB 1.6RC2 for biggest bank of Kazakhstan. They desperate for autosharding. Failure rate is 11% is good enough at bank.
Prize 1 hacking in #defcon for asshole Uzbek. He is social engineer jury and sell them 3 donkeys + 2 camels as racehorse.
Aibat call say got prize 2 for hacking at #defcon. He is manage own all wireless home router in Kazakhstan, they play rickroll every hour.
@blueben make safe you order White Horse: 1/2 milk of mare and 1/2 pure alcohol of apple. Better than Capt Jack.
I am ashame how Azamat behave in Sysadmin Day feast. He get very drunk and start yell 'Devs suck balls of Ops'. This not #devops!
Aibat call say he is meet Fyodor in #defcon. Aibat is now nmap master. He is also learn tool FOCA2. He is ready make penetration any thing.
For Sysadmin Day Azamat prepare best drink in Kazakhstan. Is name White Horse, is consist 1/2 milk of mare and 1/2 pure alcohol of apple.
In our village Azamat is give big feast today. We have 3 dev+2 sysadmin is #devops and 1 old network guy he not like #devops, he like 3COM.
Have happy Sysadmin Day! In #devops we say "May router never drop packet, may server have 3650 day uptime and may donkey turn into horse"
@aussielunix in #devops I recommend Gentoo. Is hard as rock. Is also painful as when you have deep cut but is good for character build.
@jeffbarr in vacation you very welcome in Kazakhstan. I am able arrange visit old plutonium mine if Amazon need more datacenter Asia region.
@leonardovaz Azamat need learn lots of Unix before he is able play RMS in movie. You know we have RMS bronze statue in Almaty?
@leonardovaz in Kazakhstan is Mandrake very popular Linux for home user. Business is run mix of NetWare 4.0, WinNT 4.0 and RHEL 4.0.
Aibat call say for #defcon on Sysadmin Appreciation Day all go visit Las Vegas strip club for free. Is same in Kazakhstan!
@mperham I am guarantee great success with Nagios! My alerts go to a pair sharp spurs which pierce donkey ribs and his noise wake me up.
@mperham in Kazakhstan we have saying 'Old trusty donkey better than unprove new horse'. Is why in Kazakhstan #devops always is use nagios.
@swardley what you think a business idea: install plug computer for all house of Kazakhstan and run cloud. Is good proof concept #openstack?
@swardley genkuie. Good idea #cloudbarn. I make sure you invited as keynote speaker. You know Kazakhstan is #9 size country in world?
Aibat call say he is learn lots in #defcon. U S and A hacker is teach him how make ATM rickroll.
@swardley ha ha even virtual donkey is need care, feed, monitor, SLA, queuing, NoSQL and many more. Not many farmer is know do it right.
@swardley is difference between everybody know now how put bridle 1 donkey and everybody run farm of 1000 donkey. #cloud #scale #openstack
@vimtips repeat tips is suck goat. Here is new tip from Azamat: all you can do in vim can also do in combination of sed and awk.
Aibat has teach me 2 easy step secure any Unix:1)not run any command root or sudo 2)not run any service is listen on port. Is private cloud?
Aibat #blackhat skill is hack karaoke machine play rickroll in Kazakh language. Is very cruel on ear. #defcon.
If you go #defcon say Jagshemash to Aibat #1 top hacker Kazakhstan. Is easy to spot he is disguise in t-blouse say 'I am asshole Uzbek'.
Inverse Yoda law of #devops: is no dev and no ops; is only #devops.
Law of #devops cloud: who can is deploy cloud; who can't is give talk about cloud.
@yourabi in Kazakhstan for Sysadmin Appreciation Day is sysadmin allowed ride camel 1 hour then drink 1 liter White Hump (camel milk+vodka)
@blueben I agree full of #devops much more as automation. Is mean also spend 35% of time on tweet and not get much a shit done.
I help Azamat write new scripting language. Is named Kaban, mean wild boar in Kazakhstan. It is best mix of Perl, Ruby and Python. #devops
I am try tell Azamat good #devops need learn modern language as Clojure, Go, Seph or C++. Azamat say Unix hacker roll own. He is work on it.
Azamat is much enthusiast for Unix pipe. He is write interpreter like Ruby in one long sequence of pipes. Will be on GitHub soon.
OpenStack CEO @dendrobates call say they want be bought by Kazakhstan govt too. They want better compete with Eucalyptus and EC2.
Azamat is study be vi ninja. He is show me how edit any text file on vi and change to valid Perl with simple sequence Ctrl command.
I am try EC2 cloud for Kazakhstan govt. I am use #boto is very easy. I am propose to Kazakhstan govt buy Eucalyptus where is @garnaat work.
Amazon datacenter security very good is 3 way: thing you have like pen or key;thing you know is PIN 6582;thing you are is moustache.
I visit open house for new Amazon datacenter in old plutonium mine. Is very nice, have nuclear power not traditional power made by donkey.
Kazakhstan mines industry update: Amazon is buy old plutonium mines like a crazy. Uzbek source is tell me they start new Asia region EC2.
@obfuscurity so true. I am keep say to Azamat stop bitching and start a cloud or something. He say he is learn be vi ninja for now.
Great success! I convince Kazakhstan govt not use Azure cloud. I have them open 173 remote desktop session into cloud and everything freeze.
@swardley you are kind man. My hut is your hut anytime you decide consult for Kazakhstan cloud.
@akahn @roidrage you make a fun of glorious Kazakhstan source control? I am port it from CVS to proprietary DVCS I am write in Clojure.
@swardley genkuie for business idea and 60s utility computing.Is many 60s equipment in Kazakhstan so cloud easy here then.I will own camel!
@swardley in Kazakhstan camel many more value as donkey. I am dream own camel but 1st I need be top cloud expert as you. You drive Ferrari?
Azamat say MS Azure is used called Hotmail and is use FreeBSD. Is true?
Kazakhstan government call say Microsoft is flex monopoly muscle, is make mandatory Azure cloud. Is somebody know what is?
@swardley genkuie. In Kazakhstan we live huts. I start build luxury hut with 2 donkey barn. You have camel?
@zedshaw you big Python fanatic, why not use supervisor?
@darkuncle my Uzbek source usual very reliable. Maybe he got a mix up. Could be EMC buy Cisco soon then.
@solarce good suggest but my Uzbek source is tell me Cisco is buy Vmware soon. I not want monopoly in Kazakhstan, already have Microsoft.
@cgoldberg it may or it not may. I can not able say, is proprietary information. I just say it does involve beasts.
@cgoldberg @solarce NewServer is full horse shit. If Kazakhstan need 5000 instance today,NewServer have as many bare metal server on stock?
Is true #1 top expert in cloud is @swardley? At least if judge by his tweet. Maybe I need ask his opinion for Kazakhstan cloud.
@martiboheme genkuie. My cloud is your cloud. You have work in cloud #devops?
@smulc on What is cloud, I have answer. Is when you need 1 #devops only for run API for spin and kill server. Is like root on 1000 server.
@dstieglitz @smulc genkuie, I have Azamat look in Eucalyptus. Kazakhstan govt is want spend opex not capex. I need look public cloud.
Kazakhstan government say OpenStack is a shit, not ready production. They ask I find other cloud solution. What I do?
Azamat like build RedHat server in kickstart,add 2 number in bc then destroy server rm -rf /. He not know but he is make cloud computing.
Azamat make first Unix #devops fuckup. He mean run 'df -h /' and he type 'rm -rf /'. He still in shock of superpower feel he got.
@cscotta I am confuse. You not like MongoDB? In Kazakshstan #devops use precompiled MongoDB. Is mostly use in banking industry.
Also Azamat is learn many Unix tools. He is make dirty joke involve 'cat' and 'finger'. I can not able repeat here.
@cscotta I like your blog on polyglot very much. Is #devops approach too. All Linux flavor good in some way, just not use Windows.
Azamat is fire up of Unix so far. Only thing he did not like what I teach is emacs. He like vi very much. He say emacs user suck goat.
Too many Unix theory for Azamat, now practical: he is install Slackware 0.8 from 12 floppy disk.
Unix lesson #4: in Unix no need small mouse or screen self touch. All need is command prompt and single command named emacs.
Unix lesson #3: when Windows user learn Unix they set root password be 'p@$$w0rd' or 'changeme'. Beware Thor smash head in.
Unix lesson #2: is exist 1 user has superpower of melt server metal. Is name root or roht, is come from hammer god Thor spell back.
Unix lesson #1: for know Unix well you have need beard, sandal with sock and small horse tail.
I am teach Azamat Unix. He desperate get job as #devops and can not able because he is know only Windows NT.
Kazakhstan smartphone market update: BlueBerry is make come back, but ByePhone and Androgyn still is have market pie share.
@obfuscurity genkuie for clarify reboot. In Kazakhstan nightly reboot of Windows is find in best practice manual.
In Kazakhstan we have saying: if horse is lame, better kill so not suffer. For #devops do same with your Windows server.
I am watch Astana team best in France Tour. Guess who maintain their #devops infrastructure. #novellnetware #win.
@JordanRinke I like! I have tell Azamat from now use small lego. He like learn TCP with live horse. Many congestion.
@JordanRinke if you not know TCP 3-way handshake then peek will not help.
@JordanRinke my water well is your water well. But my copy of Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated I not share.
Borat's law of #devops: sexytime you have at home is inverse proportional with sexytime you have with infrastructure.
Are 3 things Kazakhstan #devops not share: his woman, his horse and his copy of Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated.
Capacity plan Unix: add load average on all Unix server, divide to number Unix server. Is number new server need buy. This no joke.
Capacity plan Windows: count blue screen death in infrastructure, divide to number Windows servers. Is number new server need order.
I finish capacity planning book of @allspaw. I like. Much complicate formula for know when buy new server. I give you best formula.
Also in Kazakhstan economy 1 camel very expensive, many more as 1 #devops. Is almost same as hire @allspaw.
I read @adamhjk tweet say #devops is culture, can not buy. Hahahahaha. In Kazakhstan you can able hire 1 #devops same price of 1 horse.
You know Kazakhstan #1 in Mac/iPhone/iPad sold per head of people? Here my father kiss statue of Steve Jobs. http://twitpic.com/27zkoi
@dstieglitz your horse my horse, my water well your water well.
@ShitMyDevOpSays I have ask @feministhulk, she very excite. Is she hottie? Maybe we put her in booth at conferences.
I am start consulting company with @DBAHULK and @ShitMyDevOpSays. We SMASH your infrastructure and do rebuild in cloud. Is very cheap.
@ianmeyer I excite too! You like #devops? In Kazakhstan we have expression "my horse is your horse" when we follow each other tweet.

I tell a joke to Azamat. How many #devops it take to change light bulb? Only one, but need root access. Azamat not get it, he use Windows.
#devops to psychiatrist:Had bad dream, sky dark, full clouds, and no firewall protect network. Doctor:Is OK, with cloud no need firewall.
In Kazakhstan we have a good humor: why is beginner #devops afraid go on inflatable boat on ocean? Because afraid of wireshark. You like?

@joestump I am use @simplegeo API pirated by assholes Uzbeks. Work 43% of time, not very bad when look at original API which work 57% time.
I see Inception on DVD pirated by assholes Uzbeks. Very good #devops lesson: if data center go dark and quiet, it only is dream.
@moonpolysoft in #devops we not do politic. We do service-oriented or SOA for money (we prostitutes).
I have first config management implementation: chef cookbook that do grafitti on puppet dashboard, then uninstall of a puppetmaster. #oscon
@ShitMyDevOpSays in #devops we not run sudo, only root direct. Good idea for sexytime project, I discuss with Azamat. I excite already.
@ShitMyDevOpSays Azamat say you are genie, I believe now. I work at config management, I have good #devops ideas, not time to implement.
